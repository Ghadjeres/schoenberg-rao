# Schoenberg-Rao distances
Code accompanying the "Schoenberg-Rao distances: Entropy-based and Geometry-aware Statistical Hilbert Distances" paper by Hadjeres and Nielsen.

Barycenters computation of Fig. 5 is done in the `barycenters.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
The Schoenberg-Rao Auto-Encoder is in the `SRAE.py` file. Use `python SRAE.py -h` for the available parameters.
All other figures are reproducible with the `main.ipynb` notebook.
Results from different SRAE settings are included in the `resutls_*`folders.
